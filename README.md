# Challenge 1: Temperature Matrix

In this challenge, you'll develop an algorithm to calculate the average temperatures across different cities over the span of a week, using a matrix. The matrix will store the daily temperatures of five cities across seven days.

## Requirements:

- Use a 5x7 matrix, where rows represent the cities, and columns represent the days.
- The algorithm must:
  - Prompt the user to input the temperature for each city, for each day.
  - Calculate and display the weekly average temperature for each city.
  - Calculate and display the overall average temperature of all cities for the week.
  - Identify and display the city with the highest average temperature.

## What improve?

This exercise will help you deepen your understanding of navigating through matrices, summing values in specific rows or columns, and calculating averages. Itâ€™s an excellent next step after working with simple sums of vectors and matrices.
